# <p align="center">CPU Scheduling Calculator</p>

## Description :-

This project is a web-based CPU Scheduling Calculator that computes the wait time and turnaround time for various CPU scheduling algorithms. Users can input arrival times, burst times, and optionally a time quantum for the Round-Robin (RR) algorithm. The application supports the following scheduling algorithms:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round-Robin (RR)

After entering the required data, the calculator processes the information and displays a detailed output table with the scheduling results, including the start time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.
